## Security & Exposure

### KI-001 — Unauthenticated HTTP API and `/ws` terminal surface

- **Status**: Open (accepted limitation by design; needs explicit user/PM decision before any non-loopback use).
- **Category**: Product / security.
- **Affected modules / surfaces**: `src/backend/server.ts` (no auth hook, no CORS/origin policy), all `src/backend/api/*` routes, `src/backend/ws/terminal-ws.ts`, `src/main.ts` (`--host=` flag).
- **Current gap**: The backend registers every `/api/*` route and the `/ws/terminal/:id` WebSocket with no authentication, authorization, or origin/CSRF check. These surfaces can spawn processes (`runtime.createSession`), run `git`, read/write the filesystem and `vcmDataDir`, manage gateway tokens, and write raw bytes directly into role PTYs (`runtime.write` via the terminal WebSocket). The default bind is `127.0.0.1`, but `--host=` lets a user bind to `0.0.0.0`/LAN, and the WS upgrade path performs no `Origin` validation (cross-site WebSocket hijacking is possible if a browser session is open).
- **Impact**: Binding to any non-loopback interface exposes a powerful, fully unauthenticated remote-code-execution-equivalent surface to the local network. Even on loopback, the lack of `Origin` checks means a malicious web page in the user's browser could drive the API/terminal.
- **Mitigation / workaround**: Keep the default `127.0.0.1` bind; do not pass `--host=` with a routable address; do not run VCM on shared/untrusted machines.
- **Resolution condition**: Either (a) document and enforce loopback-only as a hard product constraint, or (b) add an auth/token + `Origin` allowlist before allowing non-loopback binds. Requires a product decision (route through the full code-change flow if a fix is chosen).
- **Related**: KI-002, KI-007.

### KI-002 — Gateway bot token and app secret stored in plaintext at rest

- **Status**: Open (accepted limitation).
- **Category**: Product / security.
- **Affected modules / surfaces**: `src/backend/gateway/gateway-settings-service.ts` (`writeJsonAtomic(settingsPath, cachedSettings)`), gateway channel credentials (`binding.token`, `binding.appSecret`).
- **Current gap**: Gateway channel credentials (Weixin iLink bot token, Lark app secret) are persisted unencrypted as JSON under `vcmDataDir`. Status responses correctly expose only `tokenConfigured`/`appSecretConfigured` booleans, so the leak is at-rest only, not over the status API.
- **Impact**: Anyone with read access to the user's `vcmDataDir` (backups, sync tools, other local users) can recover live chat-platform bot credentials.
- **Mitigation / workaround**: Protect `vcmDataDir` filesystem permissions; rotate tokens if the data dir is exposed.
- **Resolution condition**: Encrypt secrets at rest or delegate to an OS keychain; or formally accept and document the plaintext-at-rest model.
- **Related**: KI-001.

## Correctness & Robustness

### KI-003 — Spawn failures are indistinguishable from real `git` exit code 1

- **Status**: Open.
- **Category**: Product / correctness.
- **Affected modules / surfaces**: `src/backend/adapters/command-runner.ts` (catch branch returns `{ exitCode: 1, stderr: error.message }`), `src/backend/adapters/git-adapter.ts` (`isIgnored`, `branchExists` treat `exitCode === 1` as a definitive "false").
- **Current gap**: `command-runner.run` collapses every `execa` failure — including a spawn error such as `git` not being installed/launchable (ENOENT) — into `exitCode: 1`. Several git-adapter methods (`isIgnored`, `branchExists`) interpret `exitCode === 1` as a meaningful negative result ("not ignored" / "branch does not exist"). A missing or unspawnable `git` therefore returns a confident wrong answer instead of surfacing the real failure.
- **Impact**: Downstream logic (worktree creation, ignore checks, branch existence gating) can silently make wrong decisions when `git` is absent or the spawn fails, masking the root cause and producing confusing secondary errors.
- **Mitigation / workaround**: Ensure `git` is installed and on `PATH` before use.
- **Resolution condition**: Distinguish spawn/launch errors from non-zero process exits in `command-runner` (e.g., a sentinel exit code or a typed `spawnFailed` flag) and have git-adapter treat spawn failure as an error rather than a `false` result. Requires a cross-file contract change → route through the full code-change flow.
- **Related**: none.

### KI-004 — Claude transcript project-directory hashing does not match Claude Code's encoding

- **Status**: Open.
- **Category**: Product / correctness (external coupling to Claude Code's on-disk format).
- **Affected modules / surfaces**: `src/backend/services/claude-transcript-service.ts` (`projectHash`, `projectsTranscriptDir`, `claudeTranscriptPath`, `resolveExistingClaudeTranscriptPath`), translation panel and question/todo extraction that depend on it.
- **Current gap**: `projectHash` only replaces `[/\s]+` with `-`, which does not reproduce Claude Code's actual project-directory encoding (which also encodes `.` and other path characters). The primary path lookup can therefore miss; correctness currently leans on the fallback full scan `findClaudeTranscriptPathBySessionId`, which picks the most-recently-modified `<sessionId>.jsonl` across all project dirs.
- **Impact**: If Claude changes its encoding, or two project directories produce a colliding hash / share a session-id filename, transcript resolution can attach to the wrong file or fail to find one, breaking translation feed and question/todo surfacing. The fallback masks the brittleness rather than fixing it.
- **Mitigation / workaround**: Rely on the `session.transcriptPath` / `claudeSessionId` resolution path; the mtime-sorted fallback usually recovers the right file.
- **Resolution condition**: Mirror Claude Code's real directory-encoding scheme (or resolve transcript paths via a documented Claude API/contract) instead of an approximate replace. Treat the encoding as an external-contract assumption to re-verify on Claude Code upgrades.
- **Related**: KI-005.

## Performance & Scalability

### KI-005 — Synchronous filesystem I/O and full-file replay on the event loop in `TranscriptTail`

- **Status**: Open.
- **Category**: Product / performance.
- **Affected modules / surfaces**: `src/backend/services/claude-transcript-service.ts` (`TranscriptTail.start/flush/replayHistory/replaySince`), translation worker/feed consumers.
- **Current gap**: Transcript tailing uses synchronous `statSync`/`openSync`/`readSync` on every flush and `readFileSync` for replay, all on the main event-loop thread, with a 1s poll timer per subscribed session. Replay (`replayHistory`/`replaySince`) reads the entire JSONL transcript into memory and parses every line synchronously.
- **Impact**: Long-lived sessions accumulate large transcripts; with multiple concurrent role sessions each tailing + replaying, synchronous reads can stall the event loop and spike memory, degrading API/WS responsiveness.
- **Mitigation / workaround**: Practical session/transcript sizes are usually small; impact is bounded by transcript length and session count.
- **Resolution condition**: Move to async/streamed reads, bound replay (cap bytes/lines read), and/or offload tailing; treat as a scalability hardening item.
- **Related**: KI-004, KI-006.

### KI-006 — O(n)-per-chunk terminal replay buffer recomputation

- **Status**: Open.
- **Category**: Product / performance.
- **Affected modules / surfaces**: `src/backend/runtime/node-pty-runtime.ts` (`appendTerminalReplay`, `tailTerminalReplay`, invoked on every `child.onData`).
- **Current gap**: On every PTY output chunk, `appendTerminalReplay` concatenates the existing buffer with the new data and re-tails to the 2 MB cap, and `tailTerminalReplay` recomputes `Buffer.byteLength` inside a trimming loop. This is O(buffer size) per chunk regardless of chunk size.
- **Impact**: Chatty/high-throughput Claude sessions trigger repeated multi-MB string copies and byte-length scans, a measurable CPU hotspot under sustained output.
- **Mitigation / workaround**: Output bursts are typically short; the 2 MB cap bounds memory.
- **Resolution condition**: Use a chunked/ring buffer or amortized trimming so per-chunk cost is proportional to the new data, not the whole buffer.
- **Related**: KI-005.

## Maintainability

### KI-007 — Non-matching `/ws` upgrade requests leak the socket

- **Status**: Open.
- **Category**: Product / robustness.
- **Affected modules / surfaces**: `src/backend/ws/terminal-ws.ts` (`app.server.on("upgrade", ...)`).
- **Current gap**: When an upgrade request's path does not match `/ws/terminal/:id`, the handler `return`s without calling `socket.destroy()` (or writing a `400`/`426` response). The half-upgraded socket is left hanging until a timeout. There is also no `Origin` check at the upgrade boundary (see KI-001).
- **Impact**: Low — stray/unrelated `/ws` upgrade attempts hold a connection open instead of being cleanly rejected; minor resource pressure, no correct rejection signal to the client.
- **Mitigation / workaround**: Only the intended `/ws/terminal/:id` path is used by the shipped frontend.
- **Resolution condition**: Destroy (or explicitly reject) the socket on non-matching upgrade paths and add an `Origin` allowlist.
- **Related**: KI-001.

### KI-008 — Oversized service modules concentrate orchestration complexity

- **Status**: Open (maintainability hazard, not a defect).
- **Category**: Product / maintainability.
- **Affected modules / surfaces**: `src/backend/services/harness-service.ts` (~2160 lines), `translation-worker-service.ts` (~2155), `translation-service.ts` (~1721), `session-service.ts` (~1682), `gate-review-service.ts` (~980), `claude-hook-service.ts` (~769).
- **Current gap**: Several service files greatly exceed comfortable single-file cohesion and bundle orchestration, retry/error handling, and side-effect coordination together. This makes the intended `api -> services -> (runtime | adapters | gateway | templates)` boundary harder to reason about and raises regression risk on edits.
- **Impact**: Higher change cost and review/regression risk in the highest-traffic backend logic; harder to localize behavior and test seams.
- **Mitigation / workaround**: Existing unit tests cover many of these services; keep edits narrowly scoped.
- **Resolution condition**: Incrementally extract cohesive sub-modules (with explicit cross-file contracts captured in module `ARCHITECTURE.md`) when these areas are next changed. No standalone refactor mandated.
- **Related**: none.

### KI-009 — Error responses surface raw subprocess stderr and runtime diagnostics to clients

- **Status**: Open (low risk on loopback; compounds with KI-001).
- **Category**: Product / information exposure.
- **Affected modules / surfaces**: `src/backend/server.ts` global error handler (returns `hint` and `runtime` diagnostics), `src/backend/adapters/git-adapter.ts` (sets `hint: result.stderr`).
- **Current gap**: API error payloads include `hint` (often raw `git` stderr) and `diagnosticsService.getErrorRuntimeInfo()`. On loopback this is acceptable developer feedback, but it leaks local paths/environment detail to any caller — which matters if combined with a non-loopback bind (KI-001).
- **Impact**: Low in the default configuration; an information-exposure amplifier when the API is exposed beyond loopback.
- **Mitigation / workaround**: Keep the loopback bind (KI-001).
- **Resolution condition**: Gate verbose `hint`/`runtime` detail behind a dev flag, or sanitize before returning, if non-loopback exposure is ever supported.
- **Related**: KI-001, KI-007.
